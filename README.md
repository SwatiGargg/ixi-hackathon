# ixi-hackathon
we have created solution for prepbytes problem statement which aims at creating personalize course for the students according to their knowledge.

We designed a web app which works in following ways:-
Initially, a web page opens that gives an overview of the all the courses available and as soon as the user get started with the website
the options will be available to the user.
after selecting one option ,the user directed to the page with multiple courses.
After selecting the course the user need to go through prior assessment which will decide the level of the user (i.e., Beginner, intermediate and adanced)
after completing the course a final assessment will be done
